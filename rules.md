# Arcane Monte

Arcane Monte is a game under development.

Here are the provisional rules.

## Details

Arcane Monte is a game for 2-4 players.

## Materials

The game is played with a standard 78 card tarot deck.

## Game setup

To begin play, divide the deck into the 22 Major Arcana and the 56 Minor Arcana.

Shuffle the Major Arcana and lay them out face down in the middle of the table.
This is the *Tableau*.

Divide the Minor Arcana into the four suits of 14 each: swords, wands, coins, and cups.

Each player is given a suit.
They may sort these cards however they like at the beginning of the game.
This then becomes the player's Deck, which is face down to all players.
From then on, the player must draw only the top card from their deck,
unless otherwise specified.
(A player may look at their Deck to recall the order of their cards, but may not change this order, at any time during the game.)

When each player has set their deck, the top card of each deck is collected into the Master Hand.
This hand is shuffled and one card is chosen at random and placed
face up next to the Tableau.
This is now the Trump Card.
The player whose deck is of the same suit as the Trump Card is given the remainder of the Master Hand, and begins as the first player of Stage 1.

## Stage 1: Divination

Each turn in Stage 1 consists of the active player drawing 3 cards from the Tableau into the Master Hand, shuffling the hand, and then replacing three cards from it back into the Tableau. Then the Master Hand is passed to the active player's left.

In Stage 1, each player must take one turn, starting with the first active player.
After play has returned to the first active player, any player may either continue to Divine or begin the next stage by bidding.

## Stage 2: Betting

The player with the Master Hand opens the bid by declaring a number.
When they do this, the must draw a card from their deck and place it face down on the table. This is now the Ante.

The bid is **What is it? **

Each player may either pass or raise the bid.

When all but one player has passed, Stage 3 begins.

## Stage 3: The Trick

The player who closed the bid leads the trick by playing a card, and then each other player does so, on clockwise rotation.

If a player holds the Master Hand, they may play a card from that Hand. If they do this, they must draw a card from their Deck into the Hand after they play their card.

If a player does not hold the Master Hand, they must play from the top
of their Deck, unless they do not have any more cards in their Deck.

If they do not have any cards in their Deck and do not have the Hand,
then they may play a card by picking a face-down card from the Tableau.

Some Major Arcana cards have special effects when played.
These effects are listed at the end.
Each effect takes effect when the card is played, and then gameplay proceeds as normal.

### Stage 4: Spoils

The winner of the trick is the highest card value, according to the following
table, according to the table below.

The *size* of the trick is the sum of all the numerical values of each card.

If the size of the trick is less than or equal to the bid, then the bidder gets the Ante as a score card and takes the Master Hand, becoming the active player in the next stage.

If the size of the trick is greater than the bid, then the bidder switches the top Ante card with a face-down card in the Tableau, then plays another card (from the Hand, or their Deck, or Tableau) onto the Ante. In this case, the winner of the trick gets the Master Hand, and is the active player in the next stage.

The winner of the trick takes all the cards played in the trick as score cards.

The trick winner takes the trump card (which was face-up) into their Master Hand, and replaces it with a played card from their Deck (or Tableau).

Play then begins again at Stage 1.

### Card Values, descending

- Major Arcana, in descending numerical order.
- The trump Ace
- Aces of any other suit
- The face cards of the trump suit, in descending order

### Special cards

- **Wheel of Fortune**. When played, draw a card from the Tableau into your deck and shuffle it.
- **The Devil**. Is played directly into the Ante, does not win trick.
- **Judgment**. Judgment can never be played except for when it is drawn from the Tableau.

score cards.
